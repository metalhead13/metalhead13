## 🎵 Fun Fact
When I’m not coding, I’m captivated by orcas—known as the wolves of the sea. These apex predators exhibit extraordinary intelligence, organizing their hunting strategies with military precision. Their unique communication methods, such as vocal dialects and learned behaviors, make them one of the most fascinating creatures in the animal kingdom. True engineers of the ocean, they continue to inspire both my curiosity and respect for complex systems.
